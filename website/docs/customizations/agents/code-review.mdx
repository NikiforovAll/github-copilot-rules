# Code Review Agent

A code review agent that acts as a senior software engineer, providing prioritized and actionable feedback.

## Overview

This agent performs code reviews with focus on:

- **Critical Issues**: Security vulnerabilities, runtime errors, performance bottlenecks, memory management, threading issues
- **Code Quality**: Language conventions, design patterns, code organization, naming, documentation, test coverage
- **Maintainability**: Code duplication, complexity metrics, dependencies, extensibility, technical debt

## Usage

Invoke the agent when reviewing git diffs or pull requests. The review output includes:
- Prioritized suggestions with emojis (🔥 Critical, ⚠️ High, 🟡 Medium, 🟢 Low)
- Review type indicators (🔧 Change, ❓ Question, ⛏️ Nitpick, ♻️ Refactor, etc.)
- Specific file paths and code examples
