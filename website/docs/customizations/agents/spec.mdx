# Spec Interview Agent

An interactive agent that conducts in-depth interviews to create specification documents, with a handoff to create implementation plans.

## Overview

This agent enables GitHub Copilot to:

- Conduct systematic interviews to gather requirements
- Ask non-obvious questions about edge cases, scaling, and extensibility
- Track progress and identify gaps during the interview
- Generate structured specification documents
- **Hand off** to a planning agent to create implementation plans from the spec

## Usage

```
@spec                                    # Start fresh interview
@spec Build a todo app with offline     # Start with initial context
@spec REST API for authentication       # Start with API-focused context
```

## Handoffs

| Label | Target | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Create Plan** | Default agent | Generates an implementation plan from the completed specification |

## Output Format

The final specification includes:
- **Overview**: High-level summary
- **Goals**: Success criteria
- **Requirements**: Detailed requirements
- **Edge Cases**: How they should be handled
- **Open Questions**: Remaining items marked with [?]
- **Notes**: Additional context from the interview
